# MTAData
Code for generating a weekly dataset of NYC subway fare data from the individual weekly data files on the MTA developer site (http://web.mta.info/developers/download.html). 

The output dataset includes weekly totals by station by week, with the corresponding numbers from the same week number in 2019 alongside for comparison.
